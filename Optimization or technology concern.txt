- Problem 1 :
  If the user add the cooking bot first then create new order, the bot will not process the order.

 ~ Optimization : Find out another process logic that can solve the problem. Focus on the sequences of the process.


- Problem 2 :
  The cooking bot's program logic can be write better. The way for the current program cannot confirm all the bot is being used.

 ~ Optimization : Try to learn more concurrent coding method and make the process become better.
